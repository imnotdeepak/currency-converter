# currency-converter

this program takes one currency and calculates + prints out the selected currency

function to run this program: python3 app.py or python app.py

this program utilizes the Alpha Vantage API, which allows us to use their currency exchange rate. I have left out my api key for the sake of costs, but you can use your own api key.

With the way that our interface is set up, you'll be able to enter the amount of one currency that you like and exchange that amount into another currency of your choosing.
